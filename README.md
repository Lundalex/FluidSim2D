# FluidSim2D

This is part of the "Simulation" project.

Features a performant GPU based 2D SPH fluid sim for simulating liquids, gases, and softbodies.
Simulates most aspects of fluids, i.e pressure, viscosity, elasticity, plasticity, temperature, etc.

Also integrated with a line based rigid body simulation.
