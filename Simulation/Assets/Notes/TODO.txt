Make the simulation look the same in the editor as during runtime.

Rename PData properties with shortened versions, with first character in lower case

Sudo code for RB-P simulation:

Simulate P-P
Simulate RB-RB

Simulate RB-P:
- Kernel 1:
  - For each particle, for each rigidbody, if in range of maxRadius, bool CHECKCOLLISION
  CHECKCOLLISION -> return (check if inside (ray-line even/odd test))
  - If (inside): mark particle with flag data, and add impulse to RB (interlocked add + groupshared)
- Kernel 2:
  - Move rigid bodies
- Kernel 3:
  - Recalculate flagged particles' positions as the closest intersection point for each intersection
Possible optimisations:
- Avoid checking for each particle. Instead, use some tree structure
- Tree-travelsal for inside/outside test (probably useful for RB-RB simula4tion as well)
