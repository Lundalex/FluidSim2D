-- Available variables --

TargetDensity
MaxInfluenceRadius
Pressure
NearPressure
Viscosity
Elasticity
Plasticity
Stickyness
Temperature
Gravity

(Damping)

-- Liquids --

MaxInfluenceRadius is set LOW
Temperature(dynamic) - Temperature has a small impact on the TargetDensity
TargetDensity - Pressure, NearPressure -> attractive AND repulsive forces
Viscosity
Elasticity, Plasticity
Stickyness - Liquids stick to rigid bodies

-- Gases --

MaxInfluenceRadius is set HIGH
Temperature(dynamic) - Temperature has an impact on the Pressure accoding to the IDEAL GAS LAW
Temperature(dynamic) - As temperature increases, particle friction (Viscosity) also increases
Pressure -> repulsive forces ONLY
Viscosity

-- Solids --

MaxInfluenceRadius is set VERY LOW
Temperature(dynamic) - Temperature has many effects, such as on Viscosity, Elasticity, Plasticity
Viscosity is set VERY HIGH
Elasticity and Plasticity vary from material to material

-- State changes --

State changes happen if abs(Temperature - StateChangeTemperatureThreshold) > StateChangePadding
StateChangePadding hinders particles from switching state multiple times in quick succession due to being right at the threshold
