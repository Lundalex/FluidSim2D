--- RB sensors ---
    Stream data using async

    Rigid body data:
        - vel
        - pos
        - rot vel
        - derived data (energy, acceleration)

    Fluid data:
        - temperature
        - pressure
        - volume
        - flow (volume/s or mass/s)
        - flow (speed)
        - derived data (energy, effect (new particle energy/s))

    Display:
        - Graph visualisation?
        - Better looking UI elements
    
    Physics:
        - Rigid body spring links (and point links) (F = k * dL)
          - Stuck RB vel -> vel & rotVel for parent rb

    Extensive shader code stripping settings for better performance. Also ability to strip certain parts of the simulation engine

    Render springs
    Improve code structure for RB simulation
    Better scene builder UI
    May be unnecessary calling all RB shaders each frame. Maybe only every n:th frame?
