--- RB sensors ---
    Stream data using async

    Rigid body data:
        - vel
        - pos
        - rot vel
        - derived data (energy, acceleration)

    Fluid data:
        - temperature
        - pressure
        - volume
        - flow (volume/s or mass/s)
        - flow (speed)
        - derived data (energy, effect (new particle energy/s))

    Display:
        - Graph visualisation
        - Better looking ui elements
