-- Strain test (w unoptimised GPU memory usage and performance) --
 - Maximum allowed particle count (before crash): 524288
 - Required dedicated GPU memory: ~1.2 GB
 - Framerate (with inter-particle springs): 56FPS (-> 112 simulation steps)
 - Framerate (without inter-particle springs): 78FPS (-> 156 simulation steps)
 - SimulationSteps per frame: 2 steps
A probable cause for the crash was the length of the spring buffer causing the designated threadgroups for processing the whole buffer, to exceed the maximum count of ~65000.
This issue could be avoided by splitting the processing the buffer(s) into chunks, at the expense of overhead inefficiencies.
